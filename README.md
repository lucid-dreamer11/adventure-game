## About
This repository hosts the code for the Sirtaki Taverna website—a digital representation of the authentic Greek culinary experience situated on the island of Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand.

Developed as a final project for my HTML/CSS coursework, this is the website I built for my sister's restaurant. The project aims to showcase the restaurant's atmosphere, menu offerings, and customer reviews in an engaging and user-friendly manner.

## Features 
* __Interactive Menu__: Explore the delectable offerings with an easy-to-navigate menu section.
* __Customer Reviews__: Read what customers have to say about their dining experiences.
* __Contact Information__: Find details to get in touch, book a table, or order takeaways.
* __Responsive Design__: Ensures a seamless experience across various devices.
