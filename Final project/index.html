        The food we create comes from the delicious, healthy
        diet of the Mediterranean where people have a
        passion for food, family and life.
        <br>
        <br> We believe our menu and the atmosphere in our
        restaurant brings the memories and the spirit of
        Greece to you on Ko Pha Ngan.

        <br>
        We welcome you to come experience Sirtaki Taverna for
        yourself and become part of our extended family and

            <p class="p-debbie">A friend recommended the restaurant, and our first night on Koh Phangnan we came here to try the food.
                We were not disappointed! 
               <br> 
              <br> The grilled octopus is absolutely tender and grilled to perfection, and the
                grilled feta was a nice appetizer to pair with the complimentary bread. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend coming here if you enjoy seafood, Greek food and great service!</p>

            <p class="p-tatjana">We eat here regularly. Tatziki very very good. The portions are very big and the delivery of the meal is very nice. Each meal is worth its price. 
               <br>
              <br>The location has been changed, the space is much bigger now and is more comfortable. Every time very delicious food, friendly environment, nice staff. Must visit here!</p>

            <p class="p-naichan">The service was excellent, from both the waitstaff and the owners - very friendly and accommodating.
               <br> 
               <br> The food came out quickly and was absolutely delicious. The Greek salad was covered in feta, the tsatziki was creamy and very more-ish,
                and the mussels and the moussaka were also incredibly tasty. In case you couldn't tell, we massively overate but couldn't stop!
                The atmosphere is also lovely.
                <br><br> I highly recommend it.</p>
